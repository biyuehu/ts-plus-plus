/**
 * Browser Z3 bridge for the tspp language worker.
 *
 * Spawns the vendored classic worker (public/vendor/z3.worker.js — see
 * scripts/build-z3-worker.mjs) that owns the z3-solver WASM module, and
 * answers batches of SMT-LIB queries over postMessage. The language worker
 * itself is an ES-module worker and the compiler bundle is runtime-fetched;
 * Z3 needs its own pthread-capable classic worker, so the two never mix.
 *
 * Everything is lazy: the worker and the 35 MB wasm are only fetched when the
 * first verification batch actually needs solving (the compiler otherwise
 * returns "Z3 is unavailable in this runtime." artifacts on its own).
 *
 * Cross-origin isolation (coi-serviceworker, booted from index.html) makes
 * SharedArrayBuffer available on GitHub Pages so Z3's pthread workers work.
